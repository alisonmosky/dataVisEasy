\title{
Extract the Positions of Spacing from Clustered Groups
}
\description{
Very similar to \link[dataVisEasy]{extractClusters} but for the gaps that appear between the clusters when row.groups or col.groups are set in the heatmap functions. Useful in conjunction with \link[dataVisEasy]{ExtractMatrix} if spaces between the groups want to be maintained or widened without actually clustering the data. Output can be supplied to gaps.row and gaps.col in \link[dataVisEasy]{myHeatmap} or gaps.row.spec and gaps.col.spec in \link[dataVisEasy]{myHeatmapByAnnotation}
}
\usage{
extractGaps(data, heatmap, extractRows = FALSE, extractCols = TRUE,
  num_Rows = 5, num_Cols = 5)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
numeric data matrix with samples/observations in the columns and genes/variables in the rows. Should be the same data supplied to the heatmap function
}
  \item{heatmap}{
Output of a heatmap generated from \link[dataVisEasy]{myHeatmap} or \link[dataVisEasy]{myHeatmapByAnnotation}.  The heatmap generated from these functions can be saved to a variable which should serve as the input here. IMPORTANT. The heatmap supplied here MUST have show.colnames and show.rownames = TRUE.
}
  \item{extractRows}{
logical. should gaps along clustered rows be extracted. At least one of extractRows and extractCols must be set to TRUE
}
  \item{extractCols}{
logical. should gaps along clustered columns be extracted. At least one of extractRows and extractCols must be set to TRUE
}
  \item{num_Rows}{
number of clusters along the rows for which the gaps should be extract. Default set to 5.
}
  \item{num_Cols}{
number of clusters along the columns for which the gaps should be extract. Default set to 5.
}
}

%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~

\value{
a numericvector or a list object of two numeric vectors (in a case where both rows and columns are extracted) where the positions of each gap along the rows/columns is indicated.

\note{
a similar output can be obtained from using \link[dataVisEasy]{extractClusters} where gaps would equal the cumulative sum of the frequency of each cluster from the output (cumsum(table(output)))
