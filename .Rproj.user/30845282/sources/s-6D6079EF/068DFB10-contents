\title{
Report Expression Information for a given set of genes
}
\description{
Based on supplied expression data set, will return a report detailing expression information for the list of genes supplied to the function. Will report the percent of samples with detectable expression (non-missing data), Percent Samples NA (missing data), and percent of samples high, mid-range, and low expression with respect to the median of each gene to detail the range of expression of the genes in question.
}
\usage{
reportGenes(data, list,exact = T, ranges = "fixed", fixed.range = 2, weight = 1.25)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
numeric data matrix with samples/observations in the columns and genes/variables in the rows
}
  \item{list}{
character vector of genes/variables to be pulled out of the data matrix for report of expression ranges
}
  \item{exact}{
whether or not to search for exact or inexact matches of 'list' in 'data'. If exact = T (default) heatmap will plot genes/variables that exactly match the list supplied. If set to FALSE, will search for inexact matches.
}
  \item{ranges}{
option dictating how the range the ranges of expression are determined. The default, "fixed" sets the threshold for high and low expression a fixed value away from the median. Will also accept "mad" which sets these thresholds as a function of the median average deviation from the median.
}
  \item{fixed.range}{
if ranges = "fixed". Indicates the threshold away from the median where expression is considered high or low. For the default case where fixed.range = 2, expression > median() + 2 will be considered high expression while expression < median() - 2 will be considered low expression with all values in between considered mid range.
}
  \item{weight}{
if ranges = "mad". Indicates the weight applied to the mad that sets the threshold away from the median where expression is considered high or low. For the default case where weight = 1.25, expression > median() + mad*1.25 will be considered high expression while expression < median() - mad*1.25 will be considered low expression with all values in between considered mid range.

##assess percentage of samples detected and distribution of expression for select genes
reportGenes(RAGP_norm, list = c("Th","Chat","Npy","PGP9.5","NeuN"))

##fixed range above/below median
reportGenes(RAGP_norm, list = c("Th","Chat","Npy","PGP9.5","NeuN"),

##based on fraction (weight) of median average deviation (mad) from median
reportGenes(RAGP_norm, list = c("Th","Chat","Npy","PGP9.5","NeuN"),
  ranges = "mad", weight = 0.5)
reportGenes(RAGP_norm, list = c("Th","Chat","Npy","PGP9.5","NeuN"),
  ranges = "mad", weight = 1)
