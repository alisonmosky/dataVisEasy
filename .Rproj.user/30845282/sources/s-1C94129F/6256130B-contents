\title{
Two-Way ANOVA
}
\description{
A two-way ANOVA for the samples in the supplied data matrix based on annotations stored in the params list object.
}
\usage{
AOV2way(data.to.aov, category1, category2, pthreshold = 0.05, additional.report = "NONE")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data.to.aov}{
numeric data matrix with samples/observations in the columns and genes/variables in the rows
}
  \item{category1}{
Character string pointing to a column of the annotations data frame stores in params$annotations
}
  \item{category2}{
Character string pointing to a column of the annotations data frame stores in params$annotations
}
  \item{pthreshold}{
pvalue threshold for which genes will be considered significant
}
  \item{additional.report}{
Option to include full output of aov or TukeyHSD, options are "NONE", "AOV","TUKEY", or "ALL"
}
}
\details{
Runs a standard two-way ANOVA and subsequent TukeyHSD on the data provided using stored annotations as the categories for ANOVA groupings
}
\value{
List object

\note{
The function itself determines significant and non-significant genes based on the pthreshold
provided. However, the AOV.Results provdied in the output supply the F value and p value,
additional information can also be retrieved by setting additional report = TRUE, user can
use any of this information for custom filtering of results.

If the the two categories provided overlap in some way (usually in cases where one of the groups from each category are the same), the effects may not be estimable. In these scenarios, an error will occuring suggesting the use of AOV1way with only one of the categories originally provided.

For cases where there are no non-missing arguments for one or more of the groups in the supplied categories, a warning will be generated indicating which genes or observations this is true for. If there is only one group with no non-missing arguments, that gene or observation will be removed from the analysis (and will be indicated with a warning). Please pay attention to these warnings as they may affect how the results should be interpretted.
