Annotations for single neurons from the Right Atrial Ganglionated Plexus of a Yucatan Minipig
}
\description{
Annotations for 405 single neurons across 4 Pigs that were assayed for expression of 266 genes through HT-qPCR.
See \link[dataVisEasy]{RAGP_rawCt} for the raw Ct values and \link[dataVisEasy]{RAGP_norm} for the normalized and trimmed data. This data is used in examples for functions in the dataVisEasy package.
