#' Normalized HT-qPCR data for single neurons from the Right Atrial Ganglionated Plexus of a Yucatan Minipig
#'
#' HT-qPCR data for 174 genes for 405 single neurons across 4 Pigs. These are the genes that passed QC
#' for all 4 animals. See \link[dataVisEasy]{RAGP_rawCt} for the raw Ct values and \link[dataVisEasy]{RAGP_annots}
#' for annotations for all samples. This data is used in examples for functions in the dataVisEasy package.
